  I’m a student at Chitkara University intending on majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 
  Hard work and determination are key aspects in defining who I am. “Quitters never win and Winners never quit” is my key ideology which always motivates me in my work. I value a harmonious work environment, effective leadership, and investing my time in meaningful places. These values are vital in the career I’m striving for. Through all the ups and downs, I discovered a core of strength that propels me to conquer any obstacle. It also gave me the confidence that I can do amazing things when I put my mind to something. I believe that by transitioning that mentality to my professional career, the sky is the limit.
